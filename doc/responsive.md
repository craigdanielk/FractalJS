# Responsive design

The interface is based on the concept of "sheet".

A sheet is a vertical "surface" of width  **360 to 450px wide**. This accomodates every modern mobile device in portrait mode. This does not fit old iPhone SE and iPhone 5 (320px); too bad for them. A warning might be in order...

## If width < 450 (most portrait phones)

Toolbar is at bottom.
Sheets slide from bottom, with rounded corners, and a handle to indicate "slide to close".

## If width > 450 (anything other)

Toolbar should be along left side...
Sheets are left drawer of forced 360px.
